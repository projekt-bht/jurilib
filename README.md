## Description
We want to design a client-server multi-page web application called **“Jurilib”**, which provides users with a simple interface to make complex tasks—such as searching for a law firm—easier to handle in their own words. This search is based on a custom-built database consisting of law firms and associations. After a successful search, users are presented with profiles and can then submit service requests or inquire about possible appointments.
